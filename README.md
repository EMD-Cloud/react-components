## Overview

The EMD Cloud React components provide a set of React components for interacting with the  [EMD Cloud](https://cloud.emd.one/)  platform. These components are designed to simplify working with EMD Cloud services in your React applications.

## Getting Started

1.  Register on the EMD Cloud platform and create an application at  [https://console.cloud.emd.one](https://console.cloud.emd.one/).
    
2.  Obtain your applicationâ€™s API token.
    
3.  Install the npm or yarn package: 
	 **NPM**
    ```
    npm install @emd-cloud/react-components
    ```
    **Yarn**
    ```sh
    yarn add @emd-cloud/react-components
    ```
That's it! The EMD Cloud React components are now ready to use.

## Hooks

### Uploader Hooks:

#### Hook:  `useUploader`

**Description:**

This hook manages file uploads to the server using the  `tus-js-client`  library. It provides the ability to track the upload status and progress of files.

**Parameters:**

-   `options`: Uploader options containing:
    -   `apiUrl`  (string): API URL for file uploads.
    -   `app`  (string): application name.
-   `integration`  (string, optional): integration identifier for uploads.
-   `headers`  (object, optional): headers to be sent with the request.
-   `readPermission` (string): option for setting read permission to file link (can be `public` for all users, `onlyAuthUser` for all authenticated users, `onlyAppStaff` for user who uploaded file and administrators)
-   `retryDelays`  (array, optional): an array of delays for retry attempts in milliseconds. Default is  `[0, 3000, 5000, 10000, 20000]`.
-   `onBeforeUpload`  (function): callback function called before the upload starts. It should return  `true`  if the upload should continue, or  `false`  if the upload should be canceled. Defaults to  `true`.
-   `onUpdate`  (function): callback function called when the status of file uploads is updated. Takes an array of files with updated upload status information.

**Return Value:**  Returns an object with two properties:

-   `uploadFiles`  (function): function to upload files. Takes an array of files to upload.
-   `isProccess`  (boolean): flag indicating if there are active uploads in progress.

**Example:**
```javascript
import { useUploader } from '@emd-cloud/react-components';

const MyUploaderComponent = () => {
  const { uploadFiles, isProccess } = useUploader({
    options: {
      apiUrl: 'example.com',
      app: 'myApp',
    },
    onUpdate: (files) => {
      console.log('Updated file status:', files);
    },
  });

  const handleUpload = (files) => {
    uploadFiles(files);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="file" multiple onChange={(e) => handleUpload(e.target.files)} />
      {isProccess && <p>Uploading files...</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

```

In this example, the  `useUploader`  hook is used for uploading files. The upload status can be tracked via  `onUpdate`  upon completion of the uploads.

#### Method:  `useDropzone`

**Description:**

This hook implements dropzone functionality for uploading files. It allows handling drag-and-drop events and managing the drag state.

**Parameters:**

-   `accept`  (object, optional): An object defining the acceptable file types for upload. By default, it is  `{ '*': [] }`, which means all file types are accepted.
    
-   `onDragOver`  (function, optional): A drag event handler called when files are dragged over the upload area. Defaults to an empty function.
    
-   `onDragLeave`  (function, optional): An event handler called when files leave the upload area. Defaults to an empty function.
    
-   `onDrop`  (function, optional): An event handler called when files are dropped into the upload area. Defaults to an empty function.
    
-   `onDroped`  (function): An event handler called when files are successfully dropped. Takes an array of uploaded files.
    
-   `multiple`  (boolean, optional): A flag indicating if multiple file uploads are supported. Defaults to  `true`.
    
-   `disabled`  (boolean, optional): A flag disabling the ability to upload files. Defaults to  `false`.
    

**Return Value:**

Returns an object with several properties:

-   `rootProps`  (object): Properties to apply to the root element of the dropzone. Includes handlers for the  `onDragOver`,  `onDragLeave`,  `onDrop`, and  `onClick`  events.
    
-   `inputProps`  (object): Properties to apply to the  `<input type="file">`  element. Contains settings for file selection.
    
-   `open`  (function): A function to open the file selection dialog.
    
-   `dragStatus`  (object): An object containing the drag state, such as  `isDraggingOver`, which indicates whether the mouse pointer is over the dropzone.
    

**Example:**
```javascript
import { useUploader, useDropzone } from '@emd-cloud/react-components';

const MyUploaderComponent = () => {
  const { uploadFiles } = useUploader({
    options: {
      apiUrl: 'example.com',
      app: 'myApp',
    },
    onUpdate: (files) => {
      console.log('Updated file status:', files);
    },
  });

  const { rootProps, inputProps, open } = useDropzone({
    accept: {
      'image/png': ['.png'],
      'image/jpeg': ['.jpg', '.jpeg'],
      'application/pdf': ['.pdf'],
    },
    onDroped: (files) => {
      uploadFiles(files);
    },
  });

  return (
    <div {...rootProps} style={{ border: '2px dashed #ccc', padding: '20px' }}>
      <input {...inputProps} />
      <button type="button" onClick={open}>Select Files</button>
      <p>Drag files here or click the button to upload.</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the  `useDropzone`  hook is used to create a dropzone, and the uploaded files are passed to  `uploadFiles`  from the  `useUploader`  hook. The user can drag files into the specified area or select files using the button.

## Conclusion

This library will simplify the integration and use of EMD Cloud services in your React application.
